Problem: system for providing proper fertilizer,manure and other nutrients timely as a crop needs on the basis of climate , soil type etc.

Solution:
We achieved the solution by creating multiple interfaces
1)prototype mobile application
2)website

The mobile application provides information in brief about fertilizers for certain limited crops , the website on the other hand provides an in depth view of every fertilizer required , there is also a feature that allows you to search for retailers nearby . The website also contains a chatbot for live conversation with the consumer along with a feedback form , giving us constant opportunities to grow.

The financial model works on 3 simple factors:
1)ad monetization
2) partnerships with local businesses
3) subscription options for premium features 
4) future ideas include online ordering and home delivery services
